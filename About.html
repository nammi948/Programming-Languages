    <h1> What is a Programming Language?</h1>
       <p> A programming language is a set of rules and syntax that allows humans to write instructions a computer can understand and execute. It’s how we “talk” to computers to tell them what to do.</p>  
    <h2> Why Are There Different Programming Languages?</h2>
    <p>Different programming languages are designed for different types of tasks. Some are better for building websites, some for mobile apps, some for data analysis, and so on. Just like spoken languages, they have different strengths and styles.</p>

<h3> Two Main Types</h3>
   <h4>>Low-Level Languages</h4>
    
   <p> Closer to machine code (binary: 0s and 1s).
    
    Faster but harder to write.
    
    Examples: Assembly, C</p>
    
    <h5>High-Level Languages</h5>
    
   <p> Easier for humans to read and write.
    
    More abstract, slower but more productive.
    
    Examples: Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby
